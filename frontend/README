Instructions for building CSS resources for Mail Archive

One-time setup
$ npm install npm-run-all --save-dev

Build CSS resource
$ yarn build

Note:
As of 2026-01-26 yarn build has lots of deprecation warnings. For example:

Deprecation Warning [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
Deprecation Warning [if-function]: The Sass if() syntax is deprecated in favor of the modern CSS syntax.
Deprecation Warning [global-builtin]: Global built-in functions are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.

Bootstrap 5.3 itself has these same warnings and Sass 3.0.0 is not out yet, so ignore for now.
Can add --quiet-deps to sass commands in pacakge.json.

Note:
In Sass/SCSS, a file that starts with an underscore is a partial. So _custom.scss is meant to
be imported by other files and not compiled on its own. @import "./custom"; will find _custom.scss.
